          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          I don't know if you believe in love at first sight, but when I saw you for the first time, I felt something special, something magical.
          I will never forget that March 21st day for the rest of my life, as if I was reborn that day. 
          A long way to go holding hands together, my love I promise I will always be with you.
          In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Thank you for being my source of love and inspiration. Our journey
          together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, my
          love. I Love You Kuti Sona ‚ù§Ô∏è
